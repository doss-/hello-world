TODO: add some nice tool to git difftool
TODO: add short bashrc aliases for 
	git status -s
	git diff<tool> --staged

i've inserted this line just to create another commit before pull request it to master

lets get started

time to use git again, but first need to refresh sweet memories about it. alas human memory is a bitch, like gravity.

----
editing file locally, without checking it out(git add / stage term)
NOTE: git also has checkout, which is actually not a revert in p4, it is more like p4 sync. own changes are kept if not specified otherwise


this change is done without Internet connection. 

another change of the file

so if change a file, then add it onto stage, then edit again - only first changes will be applied, another modification will be visible for git but not staged for commit

i need double new line to make a 1 new line on git hub web interface, i hate it.
